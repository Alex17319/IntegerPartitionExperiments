Once, we're out of memory, we can continue checking further numbers using a tree search approach. This would normally be very slow for large numbers, however we can take the columns stored in the expansion register, combined with the columns that can be quickly calculated, and use them to cut short all of the branches of the tree. Hopefully this will be fast enough to be worthwhile, however memory access could be random, so using virtual memory isn't recommended.
