V9: The approach here is to work out how to omit some columns, e.g. the first one just has a 1 at every power of 2, and zeroes everywhere else, so can be computed as needed rather than needing to be stored. V10 makes this partially obsolete, however it still may be worth coming back to as finding patterns to exploit in order to calculate each column may well lead to a better understanding overall.

Extended: Once, we're out of memory, we continue checking further numbers using a tree search approach. This would normally be very slow for large numbers, however we can take the columns stored in the expansion register, combined with the columns that can be quickly calculated, and use them to cut short all of the branches of the tree. Hopefully this will be fast enough to be worthwhile, however memory access could be random, so using virtual memory isn't recommended.
