Here, we omit the multiples of 3 the same as v11, but aim to only store a single column at a time rather than two. This also means we effectively do the clear-prev-column step at the same time as filling the new one. Still need the aggregate column as well though
Think we can also skip the whole shift-by-power-of-3 step, by just changing perspective: eg. to shift by 9, say that the bit that used to represent 1 now represents 10, and modify the doubling operation accordingly. However we do need to shift when combining into the aggregate column.
Could we also combine it back into just doing one pass?? Maybe work that out after
